# Decision-Tree
Decision Tree Classifier
A simple implementation of a decision tree classifier from scratch in python.

Description
This repository contains a decision tree classifier implemented from scratch in python. It includes functions to:

Compute entropy
Split a dataset based on a given feature
Calculate information gain for a given feature
Choose the best split
Build the decision tree recursively
The decision tree classifier is then built and visualized for a binary classification problem of classifying whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its features.

Installation
No installation is required, just download or clone this repository and run the Jupyter Notebook file.

Usage
Open the decision_tree_classifier.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file.
Run the cells to load the data, build and visualize the decision tree.
Dependencies
The dependencies are:

numpy
matplotlib
Testing
The notebook includes unit tests for each function, you can run the tests using the %run tests.py command in a Jupyter Notebook cell.
